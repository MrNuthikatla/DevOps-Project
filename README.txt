DevOps CI/CD Pipeline with Git, Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker

Introduction

This project sets up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Git, Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker. The pipeline automates code integration, quality analysis, and containerized deployment, ensuring smooth and efficient software delivery.

Tools & Technologies

Git - Version control for source code management.

Jenkins - Automation server for CI/CD.

SonarQube - Code quality and security analysis.

Docker - Containerization for seamless deployment.

Pipeline Workflow

1. Code Commit (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)

Developers push code to a Git repository.

2. CI Trigger (Jenkins)

Jenkins automatically pulls the latest code and initiates the build.

3. Code Quality Check (SonarQube)

SonarQube analyzes the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

4. Build & Package (Docker)

If the code passes quality checks, Jenkins builds a Docker image.

The image is tagged and stored in a Docker registry (Docker Hub, ECR, etc.).

5. Deployment (Docker Run/Kubernetes)

The containerized application is deployed to a staging or production environment.

How to Set Up

1. Clone the Repository

2. Configure Jenkins

Install Jenkins and required plugins (Git, Pipeline, Docker, SonarQube Scanner).

Create a new Pipeline Job.

Connect Jenkins to GitHub/GitLab.

Add SonarQube credentials in Jenkins.

3. Configure SonarQube

Install and run SonarQube.

Set up sonar-project.properties.

Integrate SonarQube with Jenkins.

4. Build & Deploy

Run the pipeline manually or trigger it via Git push.

Once the build is successful, deploy the Docker container.

Troubleshooting

Jenkins Build Failing? Check Jenkins logs and repository credentials.

SonarQube Not Analyzing Code? Ensure SonarQube is running and the project key matches.

Docker Deployment Failing? Verify Docker daemon is running and check logs.

Future Enhancements

Implement Kubernetes (K8s) for scalable deployments.

Add automated tests (Selenium, JUnit, PyTest, etc.).

Integrate Slack notifications for build updates.

Enable CI/CD monitoring using Prometheus & Grafana.


Happy DevOps-ing.
